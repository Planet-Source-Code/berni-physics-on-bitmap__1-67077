### Description

We all sean simple phisics endgines in VB work whith balls in a sqare box(Form).Boxes are too boring to me so i made one that works on a bitmap mask.

I was too lazy to put in some good graphics code so i just used a picturebox,wich was amazingly fliker free.

Also a good feture in it is drawing walls while simulation is runing.

Camera auto scrools to the ball when simulation is runing its movement is also smothend by a simple eqasion.

Comands:

Left Click = draw wall

Left Click + Shift = erase wall (caution: this works on exsiting mask too)

Midle Click+ Drag = Scroll

Right Click = move ball to cursor

Oh and leave some coments.
